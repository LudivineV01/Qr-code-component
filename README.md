## My process

### Built with :hammer:

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned :brain:

- I've used variable to create a code that can be easily modified in terms of colors.

```css
root{
  --White: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
--lightgray : hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
--Grayishblue: hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
--Darkblue: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
--shadow-color: 0deg 0% 70%;
}
```

- I think I've understood how to use Flexbox with this exercise.

### Continued development

- I'm not totally comfortable with the widths and heights of my components. Keep working on their placement on the page.
